#Sub-Generators

##Module Sub-Generator


The module sub-generator will create a new node-module in the requested directory. You will also be prompted for the type of pattern you would like to use in the module.

The Module Sub-Generator also comes with a test file in tests/

In order to create a new module run the following command.

```bash
slush lib:module <name>
```

###Prompts
<table>
<tr>

<td><a>Path</a></td><td>Will set the path of the module.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><a>Pattern</a></td>
<td>Set your desired inheritance Pattern.<a> Class, Module, Singleton</a>  </td></tr>

<tr><td><a>Private</a></td>
<td>Dynamically create private methods within the module.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a>Public</a></td>
<td>Dynamically create public methods that will be used as an API..</td></tr>
</table>

**NOTE**: When setting the **Private** or **Public** Methods,
if more than one, please comma separate each. For Example:
```bash
[?] Private Methods? one,two,three
```


###Flags
You can bypass the prompts by simply passing --flags instead.


```bash
lib:module <name>  --path --pattern --private --public
```
**Path**: Will set the path where you would like to module to be placed.
```bash
--path ./lib/somePath
```

**Pattern**: Will Set the Pattern Type.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.
